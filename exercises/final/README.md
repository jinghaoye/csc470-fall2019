Detail Plan
---
The core mechanic of the gameï¼šThere is an game object standing on a box and there is another box in front of it. 
When the user press the space key, the object starts to charge the jumping force and once the user release the space key, the
object jumps forward. If the object lands the next box successfully, a new box will be generated automatically in a random 
direction in front of the object. There will also be a counter panel on the top of screen. Whenever the object lands next box 
successfully, the counter will plus one. Theoratically the game could never have a end as long as the user could make the object jump to next box forever. When the object falls from the box, the game end immediately and a restart button will appear.

The visual style of my game will be a 3d game.

I will have a background music for the game and create a sound effect when the object lands next box.

In this game I will implement partical effect, Animation,UI, and other features if possible. When the space key is pressed, 
I will use the partical effect to indicate this charging process. I will use the animator to produce the jump animation. 
The UI tool is for the counter and the botton.


Feature Target:
---
Low bar: Having a basic compeleted game 

Target: Complete all the features I mentioned 

High bar: I will try to make more possible gameplay elements.  When the user are getting a high score, I could increase the difficulty of the game by add more feature to the box. For example, There is time limit for the current box that object stands on. When time runs out, the box will disappear. Another possible feature is, there might be randomly a particular kind of box which will keep rotating slowly, so the player should catch a perfect timing to make the object jump in the right direction.

Timeline:
---

Before Nov 25: Complete the most of basic features of the game.
