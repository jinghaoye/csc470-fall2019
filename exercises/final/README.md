Detail Plan
---
The core mechanic of the gameï¼šThere is an game object standing on a box and there is another box in front of it. 
When the user press the space key, the object starts to charge the jumping force and once the user release the space key, the
object jumps forward. If the object lands the next box successfully, a new box will be generated automatically in a random 
direction in front of the object. There will also be a counter panel on the top of screen. Whenever the object lands next box 
successfully, the counter will plus one. Theoratically the game could never have a end as long as the user could make the object
jump to next box forever. When the object falls from the box, the game end immediately and a restart button will appear.

In this game I will implement partical effect, Animation,UI, and other features if possible. When the space key is pressed, 
I will use the partical effect to indicate this charging process. I will use the animator to produce the jump animation. 
The UI tool is for the counter and the botton.

Timeline:

Before Nov 25: Complete the most of basic features of the game.
