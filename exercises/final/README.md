Detail Plan
---
The core mechanic of the gameï¼šThere is a game object standing on a box and there is another box in front of it. When the user presses the space key, the object starts to charge the jumping force and once the user releases the space key, the object jumps forward. If the object lands the next box successfully, a new box will be generated automatically in a random direction in front of the object. There will also be a counter panel on the top of the screen. Whenever the object lands the next box successfully, the counter will plus one. Theoretically, the game could never have an end as long as the user could make the object jump to the next box forever. When the object falls from the box, the game ends immediately and a restart button will appear.

The visual style of my game will be a 3d game.
I will have background music for the game and create a sound effect when the object lands the next box.
In this game, I will implement the particle effect, Animation, UI, and other features if possible. When the space key is pressed, I will use the particle effect to indicate this charging process. I will use the animator to produce the jump animation. The UI tool is for the counter and the button.


Feature Target:
---
Low bar: Having a basic compeleted game 

Target: Complete all the features I mentioned 

High bar: I will try to make more possible gameplay elements.  When the user is getting a high score, I could increase the difficulty of the game by adding more features to the box. For example, there is a time limit for the current box that the object stands on. When time runs out, the box will disappear. Another possible feature is, there might be randomly a particular kind of box that will keep rotating slowly, so the player should catch a perfect timing to make the object jump in the right direction.

Timeline:
---

Before Nov 25: Complete the most of basic features of the game.
